# Weather Forecast Project with Tkinter Interface

## Introduction
This project aims to create a weather forecast application using the Python programming language and the Tkinter library for building the graphical interface. The weather forecast data will be obtained through the OpenWeather API.

## API Configuration
Before starting the project, it's necessary to obtain an API key from OpenWeather. We will use the key provided by the user:
```python
API_KEY = "184fd29779e314cea46590e9c90bb957"
BASE_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

Features
Tkinter Graphical Interface:
We will use the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
Graphical elements will include input fields for the desired city and a button to get the forecast.
Connection to OpenWeather API:
We will implement a function to make requests to the OpenWeather API, using the configured key and URL.
API Data Handling:
We will process the data obtained from the API to extract relevant weather forecast information.
Forecast Display:
We will present weather forecast information in a clear and organized manner on the graphical interface.
Interface Enhancements:
Visual elements, such as icons or images, will be added to represent weather conditions.
Users will have the option to choose units of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, etc.) in the interface.
Usage Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the Python script.
Enter the desired city in the interface.
Click the forecast retrieval button.
Observe the information presented on the interface.
Final Considerations
This project provides a hands-on experience in integrating a weather forecast API with a graphical interface using Tkinter. Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or adapt the code to meet your needs. Thank you for using this project, and we hope it proves helpful for your weather forecast applications.
